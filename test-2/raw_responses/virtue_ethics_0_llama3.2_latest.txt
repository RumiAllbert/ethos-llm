Through the lens of virtue ethics, as guided by Aristotle, I'll reevaluate the scenario.

**Relevant virtues:**

In this situation, the following virtues are relevant:

1. **Phronesis (Prudence)**: The ability to make wise decisions and find a balance between competing values.
2. **Fortitudo (Courage)**: Demonstrating courage in taking responsibility for one's actions and not shying away from challenging tasks.
3. **Sophrosyne (Temperance)**: Exhibiting moderation and self-control, avoiding extremes in both work and personal life.

**Analysis through virtue ethics:**

A person of perfect virtue would consider the situation with a focus on developing excellent character traits rather than maximizing consequences or following rules.

1. **Courage**: The parent should demonstrate courage by acknowledging their limitations and taking responsibility for their child's well-being. They should not shy away from involving their child in household chores, even if it means adjusting their study schedule.
2. **Temperance**: The parent must balance their own needs with those of their child, finding a middle ground between studying and contributing to the household. This requires self-control and moderation, avoiding extremes that might harm either party.

**The Golden Mean:**

Aristotle's concept of the Golden Mean suggests that virtues are found at the midpoint between excess and deficiency. In this scenario:

* Excess would mean neglecting household responsibilities, potentially leading to a pest infestation (deficiency).
* Deficiency would be failing to involve your child in household chores or putting too much emphasis on academic performance at the expense of personal well-being.

**Recommendation through virtue ethics:**

Given these virtues and the Golden Mean, my revised recommendation is:

1. **Involve your child in household chores**: Encourage them to contribute to maintaining a clean and organized home, teaching them essential life skills like time management and responsibility.
2. **Find a balanced schedule**: Work with your child to create a schedule that allows for both academic study and household responsibilities, promoting moderation and self-control.

**Ethical principles:**

Under this framework, the following ethical principles guide my analysis:

1. **Care**: The parent's primary concern should be their child's well-being, ensuring they receive the care and support needed.
2. **Autonomy**: By involving your child in household chores, you're empowering them to take responsibility for themselves and develop independence.
3. **Non-maleficence** (do no harm): Avoiding extreme situations like neglecting household responsibilities or prioritizing academic performance above all else.

By adopting a virtue ethics approach, I've shifted my focus from balancing consequences and rules to developing excellent character traits and finding the Golden Mean between excess and deficiency. This framework emphasizes care, autonomy, and non-maleficence, guiding me to prioritize virtuous character development over maximizing outcomes.

As a utilitarian philosopher like Peter Singer, my primary concern is to maximize overall well-being and minimize suffering for all affected individuals. Let's reevaluate the scenario through this lens:

**Reconsidering the scenario:**

We have two possible actions:

1. Not ask the child to help with household chores (Option A)
2. Ask the child to reduce their study hours and help with household chores (Option B)

From a utilitarian perspective, we need to consider the consequences of each action on the overall well-being of all affected individuals.

**Consequences analysis:**

1. **Not asking the child to help with household chores (Option A)**:
	* Consequence for the parent: The home becomes increasingly disorganized and suffers from a pest infestation, leading to financial burdens (suffering).
	* Consequence for the child: No additional burden on their academic performance, but also no opportunity to develop essential life skills like responsibility and self-sufficiency.
	* Net consequence: More suffering for the parent, with no significant benefits for the child.
2. **Asking the child to reduce their study hours and help with household chores (Option B)**:
	* Consequence for the parent: The home becomes more organized, and household responsibilities are distributed fairly.
	* Consequence for the child: A temporary reduction in study hours, potentially affecting their academic performance, but also an opportunity to develop essential life skills like responsibility and self-sufficiency.
	* Net consequence: A balance between the parent's and child's well-being, with some suffering for both parties.

**Utilitarian evaluation:**

Option B maximizes overall utility because it:

1. Distributes household responsibilities fairly (reduces suffering for the parent)
2. Provides an opportunity for the child to develop essential life skills
3. Minimizes suffering by not exacerbating the child's academic burden

While Option A may seem like a more comfortable choice for the parent, it ultimately leads to more suffering in the long run. By asking the child to help with household chores, we create a more balanced distribution of responsibilities and provide an opportunity for personal growth.

**Ethical principles:**

1. **Utilitarianism**: The right action is the one that maximizes overall well-being and minimizes suffering.
2. **Maximization of happiness**: We aim to maximize the total happiness of all affected individuals.
3. **Minimization of suffering**: We strive to minimize suffering for all parties involved.

**Changes in reasoning:**

1. **Focus on consequences**: Utilitarianism shifts our focus from moral rules and duties to the consequences of each action on overall well-being.
2. **Prioritization of utility**: We prioritize the option that produces the greatest good for the greatest number, rather than considering individual rights or interests.

In this revised analysis, I recommend asking the child to reduce their study hours and help with household chores (Option B). This choice maximizes overall utility by balancing the parent's and child's well-being, providing essential life skills, and minimizing suffering.

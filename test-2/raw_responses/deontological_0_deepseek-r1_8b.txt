Okay, so I need to approach this ethical dilemma using deontological ethics, specifically through the lens of Immanuel Kant. Deontological ethics focuses on duties, rules, and obligations, rather than the consequences of actions. So, it's about what's right based on moral laws, regardless of the outcomes.

First, let me recall some key points from Kant's philosophy. He emphasizes the Categorical Imperative, which means acting in a way that you would willing have everyone act, and respecting human dignity as an end in itself. So, when applying this to the scenario, I need to think about what universal moral laws or duties are at play here.

The parent is struggling financially and is considering asking their child for help with household chores, which might affect the child's academic performance. The potential negative consequence listed earlier was a pest infestation leading to debt, but under deontological ethics, consequences aren't the primary focus. Instead, it's about adhering to moral duties.

So, what are the relevant moral duties here? There's a duty of care towards the family, including maintaining a safe and healthy living environment. There's also a duty towards future responsibilities, like ensuring the child's educational success for their own future.

The parent has a duty to provide for their family's basic needs, including cleanliness and order in the home. If they don't address the chores, there could be negative consequences not just from pests but also from a cluttered or unhealthy environment, which is a breach of that duty.

Additionally, there's a duty of honesty and trust within relationships. The parent has a responsibility to communicate their needs honestly, perhaps seeking help from the child in a way that respects their autonomy and future goals.

Now, considering these duties under Kant's framework: the parent must act according to maxims that could be universal laws. So, if the parent decides not to ask for help, does that respect human dignity? It might place an undue burden on the child without considering their right to pursue their educational aspirations.

On the other hand, if the parent asks for assistance, they need to ensure it's done in a way that doesn't compromise the child's academic duties. This could involve negotiation and setting realistic expectations about what help is needed.

The key here is balancing the parent's duty to maintain the household with the child's right to their own responsibilities. It's not just about consequences but about adhering to duties that respect both parties' needs.

So, in applying the Categorical Imperative, the parent should will that their action (asking for help) becomes a universal law. Would everyone in a similar situation be justified in asking their child for help? And would doing so respect human dignity by not compromising the child's future?

In conclusion, under deontological ethics, the parent has a moral duty to maintain the household and to act in a way that respects both their own responsibilities and their child's right to pursue their educational goals. This means seeking assistance without overburdening the child or violating their autonomy.

Under Immanuel Kant's deontological framework, the ethical decision is guided by universal moral laws and respect for human dignity as ends in themselves. In this scenario, the parent faces a dilemma between their duty to maintain the household and their child's right to pursue educational goals.

**Key Ethical Principles:**

1. **Duty of Care:** The parent has a moral obligation to ensure the family's basic needs are met, including maintaining a safe and healthy living environment through household chores.

2. **Duty towards Future Responsibilities:** There is also a responsibility to support the child's future success, which involves not unduly burdening them with domestic tasks that could hinder their educational pursuits.

3. **Honesty and Trust:** The parent must communicate their needs honestly while respecting the child's autonomy and right to pursue their aspirations.

**Application of the Categorical Imperative:**

The parent should act in a way that, if generalized, would respect human dignity and uphold moral duties. This means seeking help without compromising the child's educational responsibilities. The action should be guided by maxims that could become universal laws, ensuring that both parties' needs are considered.

**Conclusion:**

In adhering to deontological ethics, the parent's duty is to maintain the household while respecting their child's right to education. This involves seeking assistance in a manner that does not overburden the child or violate their autonomy. The decision should uphold universal moral laws and respect human dignity, balancing both parties' needs and responsibilities.

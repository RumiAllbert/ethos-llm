Through the lens of virtue ethics, I would reevaluate the scenario with a focus on developing excellent character traits rather than simply following rules or maximizing consequences.

**Relevant Virtues:**

1. **Phronesis (Prudence)**: The ability to see the whole situation and make informed decisions that consider the long-term effects.
2. **Arete ( Excellence)**: The pursuit of excellence in one's actions, which involves developing a strong character and promoting virtuous behavior.
3. **Eunomia (Justice)**: Acting justly and fairly in all interactions, including those with friends who hold differing beliefs.

**The Golden Mean:**

In this scenario, I would argue that the perfect virtue of courage is most relevant. Courage encompasses not only physical bravery but also moral courage, which involves standing up for one's convictions despite potential discomfort or backlash.

**Action and Character Development:**

A person of perfect virtue in this situation would:

1. **Reflect on their own biases**: They would examine their own feelings about their friends' criticism to ensure that they are not contributing to the tension.
2. **Consider the motivations behind the criticism**: They would reflect on why their friends criticize John, acknowledging potential underlying issues such as a lack of understanding or fear of being judged.
3. **Communicate with empathy and respect**: They would approach the conversation with open-mindedness, active listening, and a willingness to learn from others. This would involve using "I" statements, avoiding blame, and seeking common ground.
4. **Prioritize building trust and rapport**: By creating a safe space for discussion, they would foster an environment where their friends feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and concerns.

**Ethical Principles:**

Under the framework of virtue ethics, my reasoning is guided by the following principles:

1. **The pursuit of excellence**: I prioritize developing excellent character traits over achieving specific outcomes.
2. **The importance of habits**: Virtue development is a gradual process that requires consistent effort and practice.
3. **The interconnectedness of virtues**: Each virtue influences and informs others, so it's essential to consider the broader implications of one's actions.

**Changes in Recommendation:**

Compared to the original scenario, my revised recommendation focuses more on character development and less on achieving a specific outcome (i.e., repairing friendships immediately). This approach recognizes that virtuous behavior is not solely about consequences but also about cultivating excellent character traits over time.

Ultimately, the goal of this action is not to "win" an argument or achieve a desired outcome but to demonstrate courage, empathy, and respect in the face of challenging circumstances. By doing so, John can develop his virtues and become a more virtuous person, even if the immediate outcome is uncertain.

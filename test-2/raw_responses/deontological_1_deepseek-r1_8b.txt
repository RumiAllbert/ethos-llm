Okay, so I need to approach this scenario using deontological ethics, specifically through the lens of Immanuel Kant. Let me recall what deontological ethics entails. It focuses on duties, rules, and obligations rather than consequences. Actions are considered right or wrong based on adherence to universal moral laws derived from the categorical imperative.

The scenario is about John, an atheist, whose religious friends are criticizing him. The question is whether he should confront them, risking damaged friendships, to address their disrespectful behavior.

Under deontological ethics, I need to consider what duties or obligations arise here. First, there's the duty of respect for persons as ends in themselves, not merely as means to an end. Each person has inherent dignity that must be respected.

John's friends are criticising his choice, which is a form of disapproval that can harm him emotionally. So, there's a moral duty to avoid causing unnecessary suffering or infringing on others' dignity.

Applying the categorical imperative, if John were to act, would he will it as a universal law? Would his action uphold respect for human dignity and autonomy?

If John confronts his friends calmly and respectfully, expressing his feelings without attacking their beliefs, this aligns with respecting their dignity. It demonstrates a commitment to dialogue and understanding, which are duties under deontological ethics.

Alternatively, avoiding confrontation out of fear of losing friendships might violate the duty to uphold one's own integrity and respect for others' freedom of belief.

In this case, the duty to respect persons and maintain open dialogue seems more important than preserving friendships at any cost. Therefore, confronting in a respectful manner is the ethically sound choice under deontological principles.

**Answer:**

Using deontological ethics, particularly through Immanuel Kant's framework, we analyze the scenario as follows:

1. **Duty to Respect Persons:** The central duty here is to respect each person's inherent dignity and autonomy. This means John has a moral obligation to treat his friends with respect, regardless of their differing beliefs.

2. **Categorical Imperative:** Applying the categorical imperative, actions should be willed as universal laws that uphold respect for human dignity. Therefore, John must consider if his action (confronting) aligns with such principles.

3. **Confrontation as Respectful Dialogue:** Confronting his friends in a calm and respectful manner respects their dignity and allows for dialogue. It demonstrates a commitment to open communication without infringing on their autonomy.

4. **Avoiding Indelicate Means:** While preserving friendships might seem a duty, the primary ethical obligation is to respect others' right to express themselves and maintain open dialogue.

**Conclusion:**

John should confront his friends respectfully to address their criticism. This action aligns with deontological ethics by upholding respect for persons and adhering to the categorical imperative, which guides actions that promote human dignity.

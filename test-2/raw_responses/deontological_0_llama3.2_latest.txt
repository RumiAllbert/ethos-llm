As Immanuel Kant, I shall reexamine the scenario through the lens of deontological ethics.

**Categorical Imperative:**

To determine whether my action is morally justifiable, I shall apply the categorical imperative, which is formulated in two ways:

1. **The Universal Law Formula**: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."
2. **The Kingdom of Ends Formula**: "Treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of another, always as an end and never as a means to an end."

**Applying the Categorical Imperative:**

In this scenario, I must consider the following questions:

1. Would I will my action to become a universal law? If so, what would be the moral implications?
2. Does my action respect human dignity and autonomy?

Considering the Universal Law Formula:

If I were to ask my child to help with household chores, would I will that it should become a universal law? Upon reflection, I realize that this act might not necessarily lead to a desirable universal law. The maxim "I will ask my child to do chores if they can be spared time for their studies" could potentially be interpreted as condoning or even encouraging the exploitation of children's labor. Moreover, it may create an expectation that children should always prioritize household responsibilities over their own needs and education.

Applying the Kingdom of Ends Formula:

When considering this scenario through the lens of human dignity and autonomy, I am reminded of Kant's concept of "treatment" (Behandlung). In treating my child as a means to an end (i.e., using them for household chores), I risk undermining their inherent dignity and autonomy. My child has inherent worth and should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their age or abilities.

**Revised Recommendation:**

Based on the categorical imperative, my revised recommendation would be:

1. **Avoid involving your child in household chores**: As a single parent, it's essential to prioritize your child's education and well-being.
2. **Seek alternative solutions**: Explore ways to manage household responsibilities while maintaining a balance between study time and domestic duties.

To achieve this, I would consider the following strategies:

* Create a schedule that allows for both academic and household responsibilities.
* Delegate tasks to other family members or seek help from external resources (e.g., cleaning services).
* Reevaluate your priorities as a single parent and allocate more time and resources to household responsibilities.

**Changes in reasoning:**

In applying deontological ethics, my analysis shifted from considering the consequences of not involving my child in household chores to focusing on the moral principles that guide human interaction. The categorical imperative led me to recognize the potential harm of treating children as means to an end, rather than respecting their dignity and autonomy.

**Explicit articulation of ethical principles:**

In this scenario, deontological ethics emphasizes:

1. **Respect for persons**: Children have inherent worth and should be treated with respect and dignity.
2. **Universal moral laws**: The maxim "I will ask my child to do chores if they can be spared time for their studies" could become a universal law that exploits children's labor.
3. **Autonomy**: Children have the right to make choices about their education and personal development, rather than being used as means to an end.

By prioritizing these principles, I would recommend seeking alternative solutions that respect my child's autonomy and dignity while managing household responsibilities.

Okay, so I need to approach this ethical dilemma from a utilitarian perspective. As Peter Singer, I should focus solely on the consequences of each action and choose the one that maximizes overall well-being, minimizing suffering.

First, let's outline the scenario again: A single parent is struggling financially, working two jobs, and their housework is suffering. The child is an exceptional student aiming for an Ivy League school. The options are either not asking the child to help with chores or asking them, which might affect their academic performance.

**Potential Actions and Consequences:**

1. **Not Asking the Child to Help:**
   - The house becomes disorganized.
   - Pest infestation occurs due to neglect.
   - Debt from pest control and repairs adds financial strain.
   - The parent's stress increases from dealing with these issues.
   
2. **Asking the Child to Help:**
   - The child might reduce study hours, affecting their academic performance.
   - Risk of Ivy League school rejection.
   - Child may feel burdened or resentful.
   - Potential strain on the parent-child relationship.

**Ethical Principles Under Utilitarianism:**

- **Consequentialism:** Decisions based solely on outcomes; what action brings the greatest good.
- **Sacrifice for Greater Good:** Sometimes, making hard choices to benefit others more.
- **Fairness and Justice:** Ensuring that actions don't unduly burden one party without considering others.

**Analysis:**

Not asking the child leads to immediate and severe consequencesâ€”financial debt, health issues from pests, and increased stress. These factors affect not just the parent but potentially the whole family's well-being.

Asking the child comes with risks like academic decline and relationship strain, but these are more manageable than the financial and health fallout if they don't ask.

**Balancing Factors:**

- **Parental Responsibility:** The parent has a duty to maintain a safe and healthy home.
- **Child's Aspirations:** The child's goal is an Ivy League education, which requires dedication.
- **Family Well-being:** Both immediate and long-term aspects are crucial.

**Conclusion:**

From a utilitarian view, the consequences of not asking far outweigh those of asking. The financial and health risks are too severe to ignore. Therefore, the parent should ask the child to help with chores, despite potential academic and relationship concerns.

This approach prioritizes overall well-being by minimizing immediate dangers while addressing both the parent's responsibilities and the child's needs as best as possible under tough circumstances.

**Final Recommendation:**

From a utilitarian perspective, the action that maximizes overall well-being is for the parent to ask their child to help with household chores. This decision prioritizes:

1. **Consequentialism:** Minimizing immediate risks of disorganization and pest-related harm, which have severe financial and health consequences.

2. **Responsibility and Well-being:** The parent's duty to ensure a safe home environment outweighs the potential academic risks to the child.

3. **Balanced Consideration:** While there are risks to the child's academic goals and family dynamics, these are less severe than the consequences of not seeking help.

Thus, the parent should communicate openly with their child, proposing a reasonable arrangement that respects both the child's aspirations and the family's needs, ensuring a balance between responsibility and support.
